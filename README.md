# Javascript-Challenge

This project demonstrates the use of Javascript to create an interactive website, specifically using D3.js to collect HTML form elements in the form of DOMs (Document Object Models) and adding event triggers to elements on the page filter the given dataset based on user entry. The dataset is a sample set of UFO sightings in the U.S. (the first two weeks of January 2010 only).

These are parts of the project;UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2 (Basic and Advanced).

The Basic site allows the user to enter a date in the date field and filter the table according to that date and display it once the "Filter Table" button is pressed or the Enter key is pressed on the keyboard.

The Advanced site allows more filters for the user including Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. The user can enter one or any number of these filters to return the filtered table displayed on the page.

## Personal comments on working on the project:
While working on the assignment and clearing the code I faced the problem that was not resolved even with the help of educational support team. Data was not filtering  though the code and links in it seem to be fine. I seek the help of my Instructor, TA and Tutor and we are still figuring out what's causing the problem.
